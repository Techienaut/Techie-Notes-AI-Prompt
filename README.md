# 1. Preface
- This is specifically made for Notion AI. Although if anyone wants to create a new prompt based on it, for ChatGPT, Claude, or any Generic LLM -- Please feel free to make it! And even add it as a pull request!

# 2. Requirements
1. Notion + Paid Notion Plan (Business gives you A LOT of tokens for very little--highly recommended).

# 3. Prompt
- For best results, go my publist page of "Techie-Notes" and Add it to Your Notion, and use it as a prompt for your Notion AI https://past-tortoise-818.notion.site/Techie-Notes-v1-2fefd687c17280ed8d29df8ce1caca55?source=copy_link
- Alternatively, you can use "Techie-Notes.md"--but I find it doesn't preserve the same formatting that the public Notion Doc does (I think it's a limitation).

# 4. Contribution
1. Fork this repo. Add/edit markdown files (e.g. Techie-Notes.md). Please also add a link to a published Notion Doc (since I would need to copy over the proper formatting that's only allowed on Notion, and not on Markdown).
